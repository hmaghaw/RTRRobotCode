Todo and Sundry

 - Ensure variable, function, and class names are clear and precise.
 - Catch all possible errors cleanly, safely, and in such a way as to prevent too 
much damage
 - Give classes descriptions
 - Any functions longer than 4-5 lines must have a description
 - Functions longer than 10 lines should have comments throughout their body,
explaining their actions and inner workings
 - Business logic and calculations should be as separate as possible, without fragmenting the code.
 - Avoid "magic variables", that is, variables such as numbers which can greatly
effect the running of a function.Instead of a simple number placed in a 
setSpeed() function, consider making it a constant.
 - Once a logger is present (And their should be one!) make sure to have 
log statements wherever any major actions are done, such as when interacting 
with physical robot parts.
